## Disclaimer
This repository, while containing everything I have done in relation to TTK4900, has suffered severe decay of maintenance, recently. Hopefully, I'll find the time to do some housekeeping soon. Until such time, however, please forgive the absolute mess.

I take modified usage of an open-source library called ml-casadi. It is developed by Tim Salzmann et al., as described on the library's [github-page](https://github.com/TUM-AAS/ml-casadi).
