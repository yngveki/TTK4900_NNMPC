Scaled up rate of change in gas lift rate (0-10000 in 5 min, not 30) - in line with orders.

Earlier searches has almost not punished changes in choke at all, meaning a decreasing choke has been optimal. I'll try now to span values punishing change in choke
as well. Also trying to divide every weight by 100 (Don't think that makes a difference, as the weight is applied linearly),
except choke, as I want choke to be harder to alter.

Restricting choke more just made everything worse. light_weight_0_gridnr_4_14 is still the best so far.

I think the next improvement must include altering the constraints somewhat, potentially adding soft constraints to actuation.
