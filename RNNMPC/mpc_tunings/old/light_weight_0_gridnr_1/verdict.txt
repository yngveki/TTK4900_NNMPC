They are all terrible, so the search was stopped early. I think the problem was in the references that I used.

Though the references should not be a problem, the tuning overshoots wildly in the beginning. This maybe could
have been tuned away, but I think it was also a result of the model being poor. Furthermore, i want to test
with constant references, instead of varying ones. This is after advice from Lars, as tuning after changing
values is (from experience) very very very difficult.

Based off of consistent_reachable_values_w_act.csv, l. 7000, I set the references for the next grid search
to match the steady state values for [choke, gl]=[100,60], as the modelling error seems to be lower for
higher-valued outputs. I don't know if this is the best argument ("shouldn't I test it where it's bad as well?"),
but I want to first give myself best odds of the control working, and then potentially carry successes over
to regions that are more difficult to control (i.e. lower input values).
