This grid search spanned configurations of:

R: [[0.0001,1000],[0.001,1000],[0.01,1000],[0.1,1000]],

all with the same results. Next I'll try to keep R[0]=1 statically,
and alter R[1] to higher values. I predict that this will have no or negative
effect, and that a better model is what is really needed.
