Second grid search spanned values of

Q: [[1,1], [10,10], [100,100]]
R: [[250,1000], [500,1000], [750,1000]]

With the first three combinations (Q=[1,1], R=[[250,1000],[500,1000],[750,1000]]) being of fairly equal quality.

No very easy conclusion to draw, other than that it seems that values of Q should be quite smaller than
those of R.
