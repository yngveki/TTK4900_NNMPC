This grid search spanned configurations of 

R: [[1,1000],[10,1000],[100,1000],[550,1000],[1000,1],[1000,10],[1000,100],[1000,550],[1000,1000]]

And all combinations where R[0] <= R[1] gave seemingly (ish) identical results to all decent 
results from grid_search_fifth

R[1] > R[0] gave lots of oscillations and bad behaviour.

Summary:
Overshoot is probably a result of model error. I believe much of the improved performance to be gained
now must be gained by improving the model.
