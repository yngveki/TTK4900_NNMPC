Some experimenting with values for rho showed that 1e9 for both values of rho does not ruin performance (it seems). Setting this very high, and opting out of tuning it.

Some experimenting with values for H showed very little differences between H=80 -> H=120. Settling for H=80, since it significantly speeds up solving times. (Doing this
by just keeping H static, as I would otherwise have to alter parse_to_dict - don't want to do that right now, but instead keep generality).

Next steps will be trying to figure out a balance between punishing use of gas lift v. not punishing so much that avoiding gas lift supercedes reaching references.

Given desired specifications, oil rate is somewhat a priority over gas rate.

If results are very poor from this, I must reconsider starting conditions (such as warm start values for actuation) and what references I am trying to achieve. I don't
know what it should've been, but I feel like some regions of outputs are more prone to issues than others (due to rapid changes leading to poor predictions, overshoot, 
oscillations etc.).
