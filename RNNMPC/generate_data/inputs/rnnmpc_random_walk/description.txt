This folder will contain input-profiles that strive to stick to exactly the same restrictions/boundaries as the RNNMPC; no more, no less.

The thought is that the data in `random_mixed_ramp` is well suited for the Single Well case, but the RNNMPC-formulation as it currently stands, does not correlate. Expanding on this formulation is possible, but very problem specific. Since mixed-integer considerations (among others) are not the point of this project, this other route is proposed.

This is less accurate with respect to the Single Well case, but will probably yield more general results.
