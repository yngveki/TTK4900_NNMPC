The thought was to use a history size (mu and my) that reflects how long the for the system is. However, since the performance is as bad as it is, this indicates that maybe the history becomes too long, such that too much information is considered at each instance, potentially forcing the model to "negotiate" several pieces of independent data, and thus misses both targets (?)
