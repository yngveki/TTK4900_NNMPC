I chose this model over the others, as it performs satisfactory. Though other models probably perform better, running RNNMPC
even with this light model takes ages. Thus, since the model performs satisfactory and is as light weight as I need, the
choice was easy. The choice was made after tuning the RNNMPC with using this model, and receiving relatively great results.
