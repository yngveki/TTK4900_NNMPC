- n_MV is used only during initialization, and does not need to be stored as "self.n_MV"
- n_CV is used only during initialization, as well as during update of reference 
  T. Should therefore be stored as "self.n_CV", for reusability across __init__ 
  and update_matrices. If get_T is remade, such that it e.g. takes in the T to be 
  updated as an arg, then n_CV would not be needed anymore, since it's only used 
  for matrix dimension purposes, and it could be stored as "n_CV" in __init__ 
  (same as n_MV), because that would be its full scope
- Hu is used during updates => must be stored as "self.Hu"
- Hp is used during updates => must be stored as "self.Hp"
- Hw is used during updates => must be stored as "self.Hw"
