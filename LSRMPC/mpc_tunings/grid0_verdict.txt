General impression:
    Seems like initializing the system to u=[50,0] makes the outputs too low wrt desired reference,
    so very many timesteps are required to stabilize, as system overshoots wildly.

Suggestions:
- Try higher Hp; the hope would be that a longer prediction horizon would allow for smaller overshoot
- Try different sequence of reference values that start lower
- stabilize the system to higher values, e.g. u=[75,0] (or something)
